### How I Brainstormed part B
I Brainstormed ideas for part B. By chipping off of software/hardware for nerological conditions. That are being developed, Such as the Brain computer interface device which is already being developed by Nerualink (Elon Musk). As well as for the exoskeleton boots. I got inspiration for the exoskeleton boots. From the already existing big exoskeleton. Into making it so small that it can fit into a shoe that goes on your feet. Just how a computer used to be so big that it used to take up an entire room. Now a phone is a computer that fits into our pockets. I believe the exoskeleton can become so small that it fits on our feet. 
I organized all of this by Date's of from how long ago the technology came out to present day. 

### Engineering Design Process
To start seeing the technology that was already in the treatment of Cerebral Palsy. I looked at these [websites](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/icomm/id351726761) [websites](https://stasism.com ) [website](https://gomove.org/en) All these websites were softwre's that benefited  and aided sensory issues and pphysical limitations with Cerebral palsy through fun games. But there weren't any software's that regulated the main issue of CP which was Balencing. So my futuristic idea was a app on our phone connected to a apple watch that tracks balence. Other website's I looked at were [ This website]{https://www.physio-pedia.com}, [This website] {}
