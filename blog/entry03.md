### How I Brainstormed part B
I Brainstormed ideas for part B. By chipping off of software/hardware for nerological conditions. That are being developed, Such as the Brain computer interface device which is already being developed by Nerualink (Elon Musk). As well as for the exoskeleton boots. I got inspiration for the exoskeleton boots. From the already existing big exoskeleton. Into making it so small that it can fit into a shoe that goes on your feet. Just how a computer used to be so big that it used to take up an entire room. Now a phone is a computer that fits into our pockets. I believe the exoskeleton can become so small that it fits on our feet. 
I organized all of this by Date's of from how long ago the technology came out to present day. 

### Engineering Design Process
To start seeing the technology that was already in the treatment of Cerebral Palsy. I looked at these [websites](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/icomm/id351726761) [websites](https://stasism.com ) [website](https://gomove.org/en) All these websites were softwre's that benefited  and aided sensory issues and pphysical limitations with Cerebral palsy through fun games. But there weren't any software's that regulated the main issue of CP which was Balencing. So my futuristic idea was a app on our phone connected to a apple watch that tracks balence. Other website's I looked at were [This website](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Lokomat) [This Website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/whole-body-vibration/faq-20057958) and [This website](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07049523) These were hardware's that I found in aiding Physical Therapy in individual's with CP. To lossening up tight muscles with the vibration machine. Or improving a person's walking gait with the Locomat and Exoskeleton. What I want future hardware's to do for treatment with Cerebral Palsy Is put a device like the Exoskeleton or locomat inside of a typical sneaker so that it can be wearable everyday for a person with CP. Which wil make them have a straight gait all the time. By placing the Exoskeleton straps around the shoe and locomat sensors in the shoe I believe this could be done. 

### Skills
### Consideration 
One skill I aquired from thinking about current and thinking about future technologies in the treatment of Cerebral Palsy. By making the current existing technologies more smaller and more accessible to use. Just like how a computer used to take up a whole room. Now a phone is a type of computer that can fit into your pocket. I had to consider how we can make the exoskeleton straps small. So that they can fit onto a shoe and still have the same effect as the big exoskeleton.
