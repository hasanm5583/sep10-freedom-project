## What I found
The information that I gathered regarding the existing software/hardware. existing in Cerebral Palsy are. stasism.com. This website is a physical Therapy provider for people with cerebral Palsy but instead it turns physical therapy into fun video games like Mario world by having the player foot movements on a mat control the chracters actions in game. I wish I learned about this sooner regular physical therapy is so boring.
