## Context

## What I found
The information that I gathered regarding the existing software/hardware. existing in Cerebral Palsy are. stasism.com  This website is a physical Therapy provider for people with cerebral palsy but instead it turns physical therapy into fun video games like Mario world by having the player foot movements on a mat control the character's actions in game. I wish I learned about this sooner. Regular physical therapy is so boring. Another software I found regarding CP was gomove.org. Which is a website that allows people with CP and physical Therapist to do and provide physical Therapy from home. Where individuals can make goals catered to individual needs and track and set goals to be achieved with the help of their therapist. on to the hardware I found regarding Cerebral Palsy. One was the Exoskeleton is a wearable robot for kids with cerebral palsy to improve their lower body extremities. It tracks an individual's walking pattern, and redirects their walking pattern from a bilateral  walking gait to a straighter gait. As well as locking the joints in a brace to assist in joint bending. Another hardware I found when researching was locomat therapy. Which is also another fun way to improve a person with cerebral palsy's walking gait. Lokomat is kind of like a treadmill but it's for people with bilateral walking patterns.A huge robot is harnessed onto the person's body with arms free and then they walk in a straight line.The treadmill can be elevated to increase the difficulty and make it feel like you're climbing a hill.To make it seem not so boring a big smartboard connected to the treadmill has games that can be played while working out your walking gait.

## Engineering design Process

I am currently on Step 2 of my (Engineering design process) EDP. What is researching the problem that people don't know what technologies Softwares/hardware exist in the treatment of CP. Now that I have researched what technologies already exist in the treatment of individual's with CP. Now it's on to step 3. Researching future technologies that could exist in the future of CP treatment as well as researching a cure for individuals with CP

## Skills
Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are time management, how to google, and Asking for help.
## Time management 
My two commitments outside of school that I mentioned in my previous blog were Karate and Cross Country. Cross Country Season has come to an End so it's not a concern anymore. I am on HSTAT's Swim team now . Which we are supposed to have practice everyday. Bu
t to give myself time for my freedom projects and karate I only go to Karate and Swim practice twice a week on different days to have time to work on my freedom project.

## how to google
Since this Freedom project is about technologies that already do and will exist in the  treatment of CP. Since one of the treatments for CP is physical therapy. I researched Softwares/hardwares that exist in Physical therapy services. To find technologies like the Exoskeleton and Locomat. 

## Asking for help
Since we are supposed to find technologies that aren't really heard of or known by others. I asked my very good partner Danna Guzman. If she had heard of the website stasism.com or if she had heard of The locomat and Exoskeleton. She said she never heard of any of those technologies before.

## Summary
Overall I am really looking forward to the next step in my freedom project. Which is researching future  technologies Softwares/hardwares that could exist in the future treatment of individuals with Cerebral Palsy.
