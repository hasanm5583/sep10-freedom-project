## What I found
The information that I gathered regarding the existing software/hardware. existing in Cerebral Palsy are. stasism.com. This website is a physical Therapy provider for people with cerebral Palsy but instead it turns physical therapy into fun video games like Mario world by having the player foot movements on a mat control the chracters actions in game. I wish I learned about this sooner regular physical therapy is so boring. Another software I found regarding CP was gomove.org. Which is a website That allows people with CP and physical Thearapist to do and provide physical Therapy from home. Where indivdual's can make goals catered to individual needs and track and set goals to be achieved with the help of their therapist. on to the hardeware I found regarding Cerebral Palsy. One was the Exoskeleton is a wearable robot for kids with cerebral Palsy improve their lower body extremities. It traacks a individual's walking pattern, and redirects their walking pattern from an illetarel walking gait to a straighter gait. As well as locking the joints in a brace to assit in joint bending.
