# Entry 1 My Topic Cerebral palsy. 
## 10/11/25
The topic I have chosen for my sep 10 freedom project is the study of Cerebral Palsy (CP) for short, and how technology has and will impact others with Cerebral Palsy such as myself in the future. Since I have "suffered" from Cerebral Palsy my whole life. It has made me not only want my life to be easier but others with Cerebral palsy's live's as well. I did consider doing a project on legal services or Martial Arts but here's why I turned them down. Yes I want to be a lawyer one day but if I'm going to be a lawyer one day then I'm most likely going to learn about legal services and everything needed to become a lawyer in college. My other choice that I turned down was Martial Arts.Was because I already am a Martial Artist and never want to quit Martial Arts I want to do it forever. So I would eventually encounter new technologies brought to the sport of Martial arts. Although I do live with cerebral palsy and doctors have offered me a bunch of technological devices to help such as walkers and crutches. None of those doctors have Cerebral Palsy to have the creative mind of how an individual with Cerebral believes they can change the world by making their communities live better. Being the crazy people believing they can change the world and then do.-Steve jobs.
Some of my most useful websites and articles regarding Cerebral Palsy are. https://cprn.org/ and https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/brain-body-linking-microchip-helps-paralyzed-man-regain-movement-in-arm. https://cprn.org/ talks about Cerebral palsy and how to make one's life with Cerebral Palsy more equitable through caretaking as well as education.But what really made me inspired to pick Cerebral Palsy.As my freedom project topic was the article by medical news today stating how a paralyzed man was able to move his hands and feet. by the nerulink chip sending signals to the man's brain to send the signal to his limbs to move. Cerebral Palsy's bilateral walking gait is caused by nonactive brain signals to upper or lower body extremities.
## Engineering design process 
I am currently finishing step 1 defining the problem that their isn't much technology benefiting those with cerbral palsy to walk besides Walkers. I am  starting step 2 researching the problem diving deeper into the micro chip that made the parlysis man able to move. Seeing how that microchip was programmed as well to see if it was real information and not random or fake news. Lastly to speak to adults with cerebral Palsy who live successful lives and researchers who are studyin ways to improve the life of indivdual's with cerebral Palsy.

## Skills
##### Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are time management, how to google.
#### Time managemant 
I have two major commitments in my life right now outside of school karate and Cross Country. This project has become a major part of my workload and will probably take up most of my after school. So I am saving Karate for Friday night's and weekend's only. Cross Country is only until the end of October. So If it does start interfering with my work I will speak with my coach and figure out a plan. 
#### how to google 
When I googled Cerebral Palsy many topic's on CP pooped up. People's life stories research done for a cure. But what I needed specifically was how technology will be be a cure for CP. So I googled how technology will interface with Cerebral Palsy. That made me come across the nerualink microchip devie. Also known as a Brain computer interfaces. So I know when doing further research on CP. I will type into google. Cerebral Plasy's research on Brain computer interfaces. 
## Summary 
I am excited to keep researching on brain microchips can be program to benefits one's abillites with Cerebral Palsy!
