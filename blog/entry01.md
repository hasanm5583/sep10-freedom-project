# Entry 1 My Topic Cerebral palsy. 
##### The topic I have chosen for my sep 10 freedom project is the study of Cerebral Palsy and how technology has and will impact others with Cerebral Palsy such as myself in the future. Since I have "suffered" from Cerebral Palsy my whole life. It has made me to not only want my life to be easier  but others with Cerebral palsy's live's as well. I did consider doing a project on legal services or Martial Arts but here's why I turned them down. Yes I want to be a lawyer one day but if I'm going to be a lawyer one day then I'm most likely going to learn about legal services and everything needed to become a lawyer in college. My other chice that I turned down was Martial Arts.Was because I alread am a Martial Artist and never want to quit Martial Arts I want to do it forever. So I would eventually encounter new technologies brought to the sport of Martial arts.
