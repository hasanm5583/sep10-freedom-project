# Entry 1 My Topic Cerebral palsy. 
##### The topic I have chosen for my sep 10 freedom project is the study of Cerebral Palsy and how technology has and will impact others with Cerebral Palsy such as myself in the future. Since I have "suffered" from Cerebral Palsy my whole life. It has made me to not only want my life to be easier  but others with Cerebral palsy's live's as well. I did consider doing a project on legal services or Martial Arts but here's why I turned them down. Yes I want to be a lawyer one day but if I'm going to be a lawyer one day then I'm most likely going to learn about legal services and everything needed to become a lawyer in college. My other chice that I turned down was Martial Arts.Was because I alread am a Martial Artist and never want to quit Martial Arts I want to do it forever. So I would eventually encounter new technologies brought to the sport of Martial arts.  Although I do live with cerebral Palsy and doctors have offered me a bunch of technological devices to help such as walkers and crutches. None of those doctors have Cerebral Palsy to have the creative mind of how a indviual with Cerebral believe's they can change the world by making their communites live better. Being the crazy people believeing they can change the world and then do.-Steve jobs.
  Some of my most useful website's and Article's regarding Cerebral Palsy are. https://cprn.org/ and https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/brain-body-linking-microchip-helps-paralyzed-man-regain-movement-in-arm. https://cprn.org/ talks about Cerebral palsy and how to make one's life with Cerebral Palsy more equitable through caretaking as well as education.But what really made me inspired to pick Cerebral Palsy.As my freedom project topic was the article by medical news today stating how a parlyzed man  was able to move his hands and feet. by the the nerulink chip sending signals to the man's brain to send the signal to his limbs to move. Cerebral Palsy's ilateral walking gait is caused by nonactive brain signals to upper or lower body  extremities.
