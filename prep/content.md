* Cerebral Palsy is a neurological medical  condition caused at birth when the baby is still in its mother's womb. When the baby's brain can't get enough oxygen (Cerebral Palsy) or CP for short  can Occur. Some symptoms of CP are. An unilateral walking gait (walking from side to side) Speech development issues. Problems with vision as well as hand coordination issues. Some treatments for Cerebral Palsy include Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy. As well as botox injections and stem cell therapy. 

## Part A: existing technology
## Before 2010
*  https://www.physio-pedia.com/Lokomat Creation (2001)
*   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a72414f-5528-4311-8d59-3430342dc1ce)

*  Locomat therapy is also another fun way to improve a person with cerebral palsy's walking gait.
*  Lokomat is kind of like a treadmill but it's for people with bilateral walking patterns.
*  A huge robot is harnessed onto the person's body with arms free and then they walk in a straight line.
*  The treadmill can be elevated to increase the difficulty and make it feel like you're climbing a hill.
*  To make it seem not so boring a big smartboard connected to the treadmill has games that can be played while working out your walking gait.
*  Some of these games include typical racing games where you have to collect more coins then a garbage can robot.
*  A park where you must run up hills to get to the next level
*  A penguin game where you can workout each individual leg left or right jumping on icebergs
*  It also has something like an EKG screen to see how well the person is walking.
*  A straighter line means the better the person's full feet are touching the ground in a straight line.

*  The whole body vibration machine Creation (2000)
*  An individual taking physical Therapy could stand up on the vibrating machine to loosen up the hamstring muscles
*  Beneficial for someone with CP. Due to the fact that individuals with CP constantly have tight hamstring
*  Getting loose before a workout or Therapy makes moving easier without the difficulty of opening one's legs.

## Before 2020 
* 1st website looked into: https://www.cerebralpalsy.org/blog/free-apps-to-help-your-child-with-cerebral-palsy
* This website has a bunch of links to apps to help kids with special needs communication and sensory needs.
  
*  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/icomm/id351726761 Match the card (August 17 2016) 
*  This app helps kids learn to communicate using picture and matching them to the correct word of that same category
*   Commonly used in speech therapy to help kids who need help with their pronunciation skills.

*  https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07049523 Exoskeleton (2017)
*  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cda641e-2c5f-433b-a74b-abb7a66ac95a)
*  Exoskeleton is a wearable robot for kids  with cerebral Palsy improve their lower body extremities
*  tracks a person's typical walking pattern
*  THe skeleton then redirects the walking pattern into a more straight line by keeping hips centered and posture up right.
*  The device also assists with daily function that a person with Cerebral Palsy may have trouble with.
*  These include daily tasks such as crouching to grab something on a lower shelf.
*  The device will lock itself around the person's knee and then assist the person with crouching down.
*  It does this by extending the knee further than what a person with cp typically can.
*  Without putting extreme weight on the person's knee's
*  causing a fall or worse a buckled knee.


## After 2020
Stasiam Creation ( October 2021)
*  https://stasism.com Stasiam is an app that combines video games with physical therapy.
*  For example a person with CP might have weak  hip strength. One of the games on this website is a typical car racing game but to control the car you hold two steering wheels in your hand and widen each side of your hip and thighs to move the car left or right.
*  Another example is that most kids with CP have trouble lifting their feet when walking and oftentimes drag their feet on the floor. Leading to having to buy new shoes every so often.
*  Well look no further, everyone loves Super Mario Brothers right? Well in this game you better watch out for the Goombas. A player must be able to step on a wooden board in order to jump on the Goombas and not get hit by them.
*  Need to go into a tube or jump on the poll when you've reached the end of the course?
*  Well in order for mario to jump or go down you must squat.
*  Squatting can help with Joint strength
*  Abdominal and Obliques Strength leading to better posture and better upper body control.

*  These games can run on your typical smart TV, laptop or PC.
*  Used with Technology such as the Nintendo Ring Con as described with moving the racing car from side to side while moving your legs.
*  Dance pads are a flat game controller with nine squares to control your character in different movements.
*  The wii balance board that uses pressure to track a player's center of gravity where exercises become movements on screen.

Gomove.org Creation (January 28th 2024)
*  https://gomove.org/en
*  An app that allows people with CP to do exercises at home.
*  Catered to individual needs and abilities.
*  Always individual to set goals such as tying shoelaces or buttoning up a shirt. Or going up stairs without a railing.
*  Therapists work with clients to help set goals and celebrate achievements.

  

  




## Part B: possible future technology
* ## Brain computer interface 
  It's already being developed the two types are invasive and non-invasive but only record signals and thoughts
  *I want A BCI to be able to send brain signals to parts of the body that aren't receiving the signals they need to function properly which is the cause of Cerebral Palsy.
  *A device would go on the outside of the skull not inside so that the person's thoughts could stay to themselves.

* ## A smaller version of the exoskeleton
  * Has the same support the exoskeleton has except that it's smaller, kind of like a computer that can be on a big laptop or a small phone.
  *It would assist a person with CP with tasks such as tasks that the exoskeleton assists someone with.
  *An electronic lock system in the shoe would assist with bending of one's knee's without over pressuring a person's knee's.
  *A spring could be implanted on the bottom of the shoe to assist with Jumping.
* ## Balance tracker app
  This would be an app on your iphone connected to your apple watch.
  *The Balance tracker will make your watch beep when it senses low balance. Or senses that you are going off balance.
  *At the end of the day the app would give you an average balance score for the day.
  *It will be displayed on a chart sort of like an EKG chart. Showing spikes at times when balance was lost during the day.
